## Overview
Drowsiness Detection system that can detect whether a person is sleeping or awake in real-time through webcam face detection, with an alarm to wake up the drowsy person! 

## Description
This project focuses on fine-tuning MobileNet CNN machine learning model for predicting whether a person is sleeping or not. Multiple Convolutional Layers, ReLU activations, Batch Normalization layers of the MobileNet model were used to build the neural newtwork along with other Computer Vision Libraries.

## Technologies Used
